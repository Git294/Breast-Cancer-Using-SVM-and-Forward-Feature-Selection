# Breast-Cancer-Using-SVM-and-Forward-Feature-Selection
 main objective of this project is to 
 1. Feature selection 
 2. appliying classafication algorithm (SVM)
 3. Finding the accuracy 
 
 # Steps Involved 
  1. read the breast cancer data
  2. seperate the dependent and independent variable 
  3. apply forward feature selection model 
  4. assaign the new selected feature into independent variable
  5. split the data set into train and test 
  6. train the model (svm) with training data 
  7. predict the output for test data set
  8. find the accuracy of the model
